# Non-Invasive-Glucometer
This project aims to develop a non-invasive glucometer using Arduino, which can measure blood glucose levels without the need for traditional finger pricking. 
The device will utilize infrared technology to detect glucose levels through the skin, offering a more comfortable and convenient alternative for diabetes management.
